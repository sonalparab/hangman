A Project Proposal by Sonal Parab and Helen Ye

We are proposing to make a hangman game, one mode that is a cooperative game
of 2-3 people, or a competition with two players max. The coop version
will involve the people taking turns guessing letters, while the competition
will allow a player who guessed a correct letter to guess again. There will
also be a single player mode where a person can play alone if they so wish.
This goes on until all the letters have been guessed, or the man is hanged.

Our MVP will involve a text-based interface in the terminal. If time permits,
we will expand this to a GUI using ncurses. The user will be prompted to pick
a game mode, and if it is multiplayer, it will wait for anther user to join
the same mode (using networking). Then, the user will be shown blank spaces
(e.g. _ _ _ _ _ ) to indicate how many letters are in the word. The user will
be prompted to guess a letter, and if it is in the word, all occurrences of
the letter will be revealed. If not, a part of the man will be drawn on the
noose. All letters previously guessed will be shown to the player as they
progress.

TECHNICAL DESIGN
================

Server running at all times.
    - Subserver forked to process each separate game.
    - Semaphore created for each game allowing only as many players as
       the mode permits.

Client connects over socket. (Sorry unclear understanding of networking)
