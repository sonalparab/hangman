A Project Proposal by Sonal Parab and Helen Ye

We are proposing to make a hangman game, one mode that is a cooperative game
of 2-3 people, or a competition with two players max. The coop version
will involve the people taking turns guessing letters, while the competition
will allow a player who guessed a correct letter to guess again. There will
also be a single player mode where a person can play alone if they so wish.
This goes on until all the letters have been guessed, or the man is hanged.

Our MVP will involve a text-based interface in the terminal. If time permits,
we will expand this to a GUI using ncurses. The user will be prompted to pick
a game mode, and if it is multiplayer, it will wait for anther user to join
the same mode (using networking). Then, the user will be shown blank spaces
(e.g. _ _ _ _ _ ) to indicate how many letters are in the word. The user will
be prompted to guess a letter, and if it is in the word, all occurrences of
the letter will be revealed. If not, a part of the man will be drawn on the
noose. All letters previously guessed will be shown to the player as they
progress.

TECHNICAL DESIGN
================

Server running at all times.
    - When server starts, it will read the list of words from the file:

            /usr/share/dict/american-english

       and create an array of words that have a minimum of 6 letters.    
    - Subserver forked to process each separate game, picking a random word
      from the array.
    - Semaphore created for each game allowing only as many players as
       the mode permits.

Client connects over socket. (Sorry unclear understanding of networking)
    - The player will select a mode.
      - If the mode is multiplayer, the subserver will wait for other clients
        to connect before starting the game.

Subserver runs the game.
    - The user is shown the blank spaces for the letters in the word.
    - The user will be asked to enter a letter and the input will be read.
      - The guessed letter will be added to the guessed letter array.
        - If the letter was previously guessed, the user will be asked to
	  pick again.
      - The appropriate action will be taken based on whether the letter is
        in the word.
	- In competition mode, if the letter was in the word the user will
	  be given another turn, if not the opposing player will be given
	  a turn.
	- In cooperative mode, the next player is given a chancer whether
	  or not the letter was in the word.
    - The game continues until the man is hanged or the word is guessed.
      - When the game is completed, the subserver will exit and the server
        will ask the user if they wish to play again.
    - We will have sighandler to prevent sore losers from quitting in the
      middle of a game out of anger.
