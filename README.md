# Hangman by Sonal Parab and Helen Ye (Period 4)

This is hangman in the terminal, with networking to support multiplayer options.
There are 3 modes of play:
* Single-player
* Cooperative
* Competitive

### Single-player

To play alone, run the client and enter `1` as the game mode.
The game will begin, and you can play for as long as you want.
`Ctrl-c` will quit the game.

### Cooperative

To play cooperatively with another player, run the client and enter `2` as the game mode.
If there is another client waiting, you will automatically join that game.
Turns will alternate until you win or lose.

### Competitive

To play competitively with another player, run the client and enter `3` as the game mode.
If there is another cilent waiting, you will automatically join that game.
If a player guesses a letter right, they will get to go again.
If not, the other player guesses until the word is guessed or the man is hanged.

## Instructions

Clone the repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yhelen-stuy/hangman.git && cd hangman
```

### Build

To compile this project, run

```
$ make
```

### Setting Up the Server

To set up the server, run

```
$ ./server
```

The server must be running whenever the game is played.

### Play!

To connect to the server and play the game, run

```
$ ./client
```

If the game is being run on a server through a network, connect with the server's IP address:

```
$ ./client 127.0.0.1
```

Replace `127.0.0.1` with the server's IPv4 address.

## Bugs

* Only one game of collab and competitive mode can be run at the same time, meaning multiple collab or multiple competitive game can not be run at once. This is because of the keys used for semaphores/shared memory.
* When playing multiplayer, the game starts after the second client connects, so the first client is not notified about the game until the second player has made their first guess.
* Client can quit at anytime (Tried signal handler to fix this, but introduced a lot of problems.) However, if playing collab or competitive mode, the player who didn't leave can finish that game, but must wait for another client to connect with the same mode before a new game is started.
* Some words in the dictionary have special unicode characters such as Ã© that we don't accept.
* When playing in a multiplayer mode, if you input to stdin while it isn't your turn, it reads this as the next input for when it is your turn.
* The word (and many other messages) prints in the server when a game starts (this was intentional to ease testing).
* There are memory leaks in the subserver (when the client quits) and the client.
* When you run out of words (although there are about 60,000 words per subserver), and then you quit the main server, you have to wait ~1 minute before the port is no longer in use and run the server again.
* Because shared memory isn't cleared until the server quits, when both clients in a multiplayer game quit and two new ones join, the old game will continue.
* Quitting the server while a multiplayer game is running leads to problems. (We recommend running `pkill -9 server` when this happens. Or just avoid it altogether by quitting the clients before quitting the server.)
